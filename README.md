# SharePoint2Markdown

Created using .NET 4.7.2 Framework. It should find all posts on your SharePoint server, convert them to markdown, download media and update the links in markdown. Results will be in a folder called "exports" in the root.

Personally used and tested with an on premise 2013 SharePoint Server, successfully imported into Wiki JS.

If your SharePoint server is hosted online I doubt this will work and you will more than likely need to updated the connection objects.
